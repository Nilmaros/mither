<!-- ## About me

Software Developer (Stack: C#, T-SQL and Azure Cloud Solutions). I spend most of my time coding, reviewing code and discussing code. My recent work projects include:

* A pure T-SQL solution that involves complex calculations applying object-oriented principles to tackle the issues found with declarative languages. The advantage is the *almost* zero latency as the calculations are done directly on the data source.
* An Azure Function that creates a markdown file inside a blob storage after a new Azure DevOps project release.
  
Personal projects include:

* Building with a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and a [RAK2245 Rpi HAT](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2245-pi-hat) a LoRaWAN hotspot for IoT solutions.
* [The Weasley Clock](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock) as a home device.
* Studying towards Azure Microsoft Certifications. -->
